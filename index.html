        💌 A Special Letter<br /><br />
        Dear Tulakrishnapriya Chattarjee,<br /><br />
        I wanted to create this little corner just for you. Not because I had to,
        but because someone as rare as you deserves it. Sometimes, words fail to
        capture what someone truly means to you, yet I wanted to try.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        Your presence, even in the simplest conversations, has a quiet magic. The
        way you speak, the way your voice &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — it stays with me, echoing long after we
        stop talking. It’s not just sound; it’s warmth, it’s energy, it’s a
        spark that makes everything around brighter.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        Even in your playful “ajeeb” moments, or when you casually push me
        away, there’s something genuine in you that leaves an impression. I
        notice it, I appreciate it, and I remember it. You make ordinary moments
        feel special, and little gestures feel meaningful.
      </p>
      <p class="apology-text">
        I’m still learning, still growing — in coding, in life, in understanding
        people. But if there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s this: people like
        you are rare. People who can light up a space with just their voice or
        their presence deserve recognition.
      </p>

        Bhyii… I don’t know why, but I’ve never felt this connected with anyone
        before. Normally, I try to be a sigma boy — calm, collected, keeping my
        distance — but with you… I just melt.
      </p>
      <p class="come-back-text">
        Your presence makes me forget all that act and simply feel. I don’t want
        anything in exchange for the way I feel — no favors, no attention, just
        your being you is more than enough.
      </p>
      <p class="come-back-text">
        And honestly, even if all I get right now are your yawrrr or adhe khna, I
        love it — it’s yours, and it makes me smile every time.
      </p>

        So here’s my small attempt to celebrate that — a little piece of this
        world dedicated to the magic that is Tulakrishnapriya Chattarjee.

        May this letter, simple as it is, remind you that even in tiny ways, you
        leave a mark that lingers and inspires.
